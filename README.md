#MedicMade

This project was created for a young startup called MedicMade, based in Bristol. They site is not yet being used but has the potential to be.

MedicMade was started in order to tutor aspiring medical students, in preparation for university entrance tests and then the degree itself. The site incorporates a landing page, a potential about page, a pricing page, a blog page, and a forum.

The forum was the most complicated section to code, as it includes an authorisation system whereby the user has to be logged in to view questions, and edit and delete their own comments. Passport.js was used for this.

Technology this project uses:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Passport.js
- Bootstrap

Here are some examples of the pages that were created.

Styling on many pages is still yet to be finished.
